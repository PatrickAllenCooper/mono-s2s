# Paper Evidence Directory
#
# This directory contains results that are directly used in the paper.
# Each file corresponds to a specific table or figure in the paper.
#
# Files in this directory should be:
# - Small (JSON, CSV format)
# - Directly extracted from experiment_results/
# - Clearly named (table_1_*.json, figure_2_*.json)
# - Include provenance (which experiment produced this)
#
# All files here SHOULD be tracked in git.
