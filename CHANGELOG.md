# Changelog - MONO-S2S Project

## [Latest] - Environment Automation & Setup Scripts

### üéØ Major Features

#### 1. **Automatic Environment Detection** ‚ú®
The notebook now automatically detects whether it's running in Google Colab or locally and configures itself accordingly - **no manual changes required!**

**What This Means:**
- ‚úÖ Same notebook file works in both Colab and local Jupyter
- ‚úÖ No need to comment/uncomment code
- ‚úÖ No manual path changes
- ‚úÖ Seamless experience everywhere

**How It Works:**
```python
IN_COLAB = 'google.colab' in sys.modules

if IN_COLAB:
    # Colab: Mount Drive, use Drive paths
else:
    # Local: Use local paths, load local_config.py
```

#### 2. **Cross-Platform Conda Setup Scripts** üêç
Added comprehensive setup automation for both Windows and Linux:

**Files Added:**
- `setup_conda_env.sh` - Bash script for Linux/macOS
- `setup_conda_env.bat` - Batch script for Windows
- `local_config.py` - Auto-generated local configuration

**What They Do:**
- Install Python 3.10 + PyTorch with CUDA 12.1
- Set up all dependencies (datasets, transformers, jupyter, etc.)
- Create project directory structure
- Verify CUDA availability
- Generate local configuration file

**Usage:**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./setup_conda_env.sh

# Windows
setup_conda_env.bat

# Then
conda activate mono-s2s
jupyter lab
```

#### 3. **Organized Output Directories** üìÅ
Improved file organization with dedicated directories:

| Directory | Purpose | Contents |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `data/checkpoints/` | Model checkpoints | `*.pt` files |
| `data/tokenizer/` | Tokenizer vocab | `tokenizer_v4.json` |
| `logs/` | Training logs | `training_log_*.json` |
| `results/` | Analysis outputs | JSON results, PNG plots |

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner project structure
- Easy to find files
- Better version control (can .gitignore generated files)
- Separate code from data

#### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation** üìö
Added detailed guides for every use case:

| File | Purpose | Target Audience |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `QUICKSTART.md` | Get started in 5 minutes | New users |
| `SETUP_README.md` | Complete setup guide | All users |
| `notebook_modifications.md` | How automation works | Developers |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | What changed | Everyone |

## Detailed Changes

### Notebook Modifications (`Mono_S2S_v1_2.ipynb`)

#### Cell 5 - Activation Visualization
**Before:**
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

**After:**
```python
import sys
IN_COLAB = 'google.colab' in sys.modules

if IN_COLAB:
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

#### Cell 7 - Main Configuration (Complete Rewrite)
**Added:**
- Environment detection (`IN_COLAB` flag)
- Conditional Google Drive mounting
- Path configuration for both environments
- `RESULTS_PATH` and `LOGS_PATH` variables
- Automatic directory creation
- GPU/CUDA information display
- Clear status messages

**Colab Paths:**
```python
DRIVE_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/transformer_summarization_v4'
CHECKPOINT_PATH = DRIVE_PATH/checkpoints/
RESULTS_PATH = DRIVE_PATH/results/
LOGS_PATH = DRIVE_PATH/logs/
```

**Local Paths:**
```python
DATA_PATH = ./data/
CHECKPOINT_PATH = ./data/checkpoints/
RESULTS_PATH = ./results/
LOGS_PATH = ./logs/
```

#### Cell 17 - Non-Monotonic Training
**Changed:**
```python
# Before
TRAINING_LOG_PATH = os.path.join(DRIVE_PATH, 'training_log_nonmono.json')

# After
TRAINING_LOG_PATH = os.path.join(LOGS_PATH, 'training_log_nonmono.json')
```

#### Cell 19 - Monotonic Training
**Changed:**
```python
# Before
TRAINING_LOG_PATH = os.path.join(DRIVE_PATH, 'training_log_mono.json')

# After
TRAINING_LOG_PATH = os.path.join(LOGS_PATH, 'training_log_mono.json')
```

#### Cell 31 - Results Saving
**Changed:**
```python
# Before
results_path = os.path.join(DRIVE_PATH, 'adversarial_results.json')

# After
results_path = os.path.join(RESULTS_PATH, 'adversarial_results.json')
```

#### Cell 32 - Plot Saving
**Changed:**
```python
# Before
plot_path = os.path.join(DRIVE_PATH, 'adversarial_analysis.png')

# After
plot_path = os.path.join(RESULTS_PATH, 'adversarial_analysis.png')
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

If you've been using the previous version:

**No Changes Needed!** üéâ

The notebook will automatically:
1. Detect you're in Colab (if you are)
2. Mount Drive and use your existing paths
3. Everything continues to work

### For New Local Users

1. Run setup script once:
   ```bash
   ./setup_conda_env.sh  # or setup_conda_env.bat on Windows
   ```

2. Activate environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate mono-s2s
   ```

3. Start Jupyter and run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

That's it! No configuration needed.

## Benefits Summary

### Before This Update

‚ùå Had to manually edit notebook when switching environments  
‚ùå Different files for Colab vs local  
‚ùå Complex setup instructions  
‚ùå Easy to forget path changes  
‚ùå Files scattered in one directory  

### After This Update

‚úÖ Single notebook works everywhere  
‚úÖ Automatic environment detection  
‚úÖ One-command setup  
‚úÖ No manual configuration  
‚úÖ Organized directory structure  
‚úÖ Clear documentation  

---

## Technical Details

### Environment Detection Method

Uses Python's `sys.modules` to check for Colab-specific modules:

```python
IN_COLAB = 'google.colab' in sys.modules
```

**Why This Works:**
- `google.colab` module only exists in Colab environment
- Check happens before any imports
- Fast and reliable
- No external dependencies

### Fallback Mechanism

The local configuration has two levels:

1. **Try `local_config.py`** - If generated by setup script
2. **Fallback to defaults** - If file doesn't exist

This ensures the notebook **always works**, even without setup script.

### Path Compatibility

`DRIVE_PATH` is maintained as an alias in local mode for backward compatibility:

```python
DRIVE_PATH = DATA_PATH  # Alias for compatibility
```

This means any code referencing `DRIVE_PATH` continues to work.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- [ ] Support for Azure ML / SageMaker detection
- [ ] Automatic remote storage sync (S3, GCS)
- [ ] Environment-specific hyperparameters
- [ ] Automatic mixed precision based on GPU
- [ ] Progress notifications (email, Slack)

---

## Credits

**Environment Detection Pattern:** Inspired by common practices in TensorFlow tutorials and Hugging Face notebooks.

**Setup Scripts:** Based on PyTorch official installation guides and conda best practices.

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check documentation:** Start with [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)
2. **Verify environment:** Look at notebook output messages
3. **Check CUDA:** Run `nvidia-smi` and verify PyTorch CUDA
4. **Review paths:** Ensure directories exist and are writable
